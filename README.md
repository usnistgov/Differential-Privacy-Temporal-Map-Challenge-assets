# NIST PSCR 2020 Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge asesets and links

Welcome!

This data repository contains assets to the 2020 Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge hosted by the Public Safety Communication (PSCR) Division of the National Institute of Standards of Technology (NIST).

Please navigate to this link for information relating to the 2018 Synthetic Data Challenge.

This repository is maintained by [Gary Howarth](mailto:gary.howarth@nist.gov), Prize Challenge Manager, NIST PSCR.  

Tha main contents of the current repository are:
- data assets from 2018 Synthetic Data Challenge
- links to contesant submissions to the 2020 Temporal Map Challenge
- data assets from 2020 Temporal Map Challenge
- drug-related deaths dataset for testing

Future contents we plan to add:
- benchmark scripts for evaluating synthetic data generators (expected FEB 2022)
