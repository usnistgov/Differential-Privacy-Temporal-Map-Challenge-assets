# NIST PSCR 2020 Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge assets and links

Welcome!

This data repository contains assets to the 2020 Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge hosted by the Public Safety Communication (PSCR) Division of the National Institute of Standards of Technology (NIST).

[If you are instead interested in information related to the 2018 Synthetic Data Challenge, please navigate to this link.](https://github.com/usnistgov/Differential-Privacy-Synthetic-Data-Challenge-assets)

This repository is maintained by [Gary Howarth](mailto:gary.howarth@nist.gov), Prize Challenge Manager, NIST PSCR.  

The main contents of the current repository are:
- links to contestant submissions to the Challenge (below)
- public development data and final scoring data from each sprint (benchmark problem) of the Challenge--[competition-runtime folder](https://github.com/usnistgov/Differential-Privacy-Temporal-Map-Challenge-assets/tree/master/competition-runtime)
- scoring code and scripts for each sprint (benchmark problem) of the Challenge--[competition-runtime folder](https://github.com/usnistgov/Differential-Privacy-Temporal-Map-Challenge-assets/tree/master/competition-runtime)
- presentations, including slide deck from the [Challenge Demo Day](https://github.com/usnistgov/Differential-Privacy-Temporal-Map-Challenge-assets/blob/474f5ef0468a55ee11eaa5a004ded5c60946f7ad/webinars,%20presentations,%20demos/NIST%20PSCR%20Synthetic%20Demo%20Day%20Deck%2020211108%20distro.pdf)
- documentation and guides for using these resources 
- drug-related deaths dataset for testing


Future contents we plan to add:
- benchmark scripts for evaluating synthetic data generators (expected FEB 2022)

## Contestant Repositories

The following repositories from competitors were open sourced and participated in a three month development phase, working with NIST PSCR, Christine Task from Knexus Research and Maia Hansen to make their repositories extensible, more robust, better documented, and all around easier to use for general synthetic data problems. These tools can be applied to your own data sets, as well as the problems from the challenge. 

- [Adaptive Granularity Method by Minutemen (Sprint 3)](https://github.com/ryan112358/nist-synthetic-data-2021)
-- Technical Point of Contact: [Ryan McKenna](mailto:rmckenna@umass.edu)

- [DPSyn: an algorithm for synthesizing microdata for data analysis while satisfying differential privacy (Sprint 2)](https://github.com/agl-c/deid2_dpsyn)
-- Technical Point of Contact: [Tianhao Wang](tianhao@virginia.edu)

- [PrivacyHistos by Jim King (Sprint 2)](https://github.com/JimKing100/PrivacyHistos)
-- Technical Point of Contact: [Jim King](jim.king.mv@gmail.com)

We've also provided a guide to using the [R Synthpop library](https://github.com/usnistgov/Differential-Privacy-Temporal-Map-Challenge-assets/blob/7f7aed6a8dd9fd8d0da8ae977901397bf99b1e95/webinars,%20presentations,%20demos/Dataset%20comparison%20using%20Synthpop.pdf) for data quality evaluation on non-challenge data sets.  This is a useful tool for exploring synthetic data quality on your own data problems. 

Additionally, these competitors open sourced their code from the Sprint 3 Challenge problem.  Please acknowledge the use of these code bases using the citation information found in each respective repository.
