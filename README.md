# NIST PSCR 2020 Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge assets and links

Welcome!

This data repository contains assets to the 2020 Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge hosted by the Public Safety Communication (PSCR) Division of the National Institute of Standards of Technology (NIST).

[Please navigate to this link for information relating to the 2018 Synthetic Data Challenge.](https://github.com/usnistgov/Differential-Privacy-Synthetic-Data-Challenge-assets)

This repository is maintained by [Gary Howarth](mailto:gary.howarth@nist.gov), Prize Challenge Manager, NIST PSCR.  

The main contents of the current repository are:
- links to contestant submissions to the Challenge (below)
- public and sequestered data from the Challenge
- scoring code and scripts for the Challenge
- drug-related deaths dataset for testing
- documentation and guides for using these resources

Future contents we plan to add:
- benchmark scripts for evaluating synthetic data generators (expected FEB 2022)
