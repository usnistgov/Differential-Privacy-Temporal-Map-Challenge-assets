title: "SDNist: Benchmark Data and Evaluation Tools for Data Sythesizers"
abstract: "We present a set of benchmark data and metrics for the evaluation of synthetic data generators on structured tabular data. These benchmarks are distributed as a simple open-source Python package to allow standardized and reproducible comparison of synthetic generator models on real-world data and use cases. These data and metrics were developed for and vetted through the NIST PSCR Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge; the evaluation tools, k-marginal and Higher Order Conjunction, proved effective in distinguishing competing models in the competition environment."
